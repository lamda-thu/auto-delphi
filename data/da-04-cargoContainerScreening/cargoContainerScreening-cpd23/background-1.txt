Background:
The decision-making problem in question revolves around making security choices at a checkpoint where there is a potential risk of a smuggled nuclear threat in the container. You need to decide whether to screen the containers. Screening may trigger alarms when threats are present, and may deter the terrorists. Downstream decision on inspection depends on the screening decision and whether the alarm goes off. The entire sequence and combination of decisions and outcomes have financial implications, manifesting in various cost types, such as the cost of screening, inspection, radiological disposal, and in worst-case scenarios, costs associated with a terrorist attack. Essentially, the decision-making process aims to balance the safety concerns against the costs incurred while addressing the risk of nuclear threats.
