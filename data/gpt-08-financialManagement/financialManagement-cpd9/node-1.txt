Background:
In the decision-making scenario, a person is faced with the decision of how to invest their money. The outcome of this decision, which is the person's future wealth, depends on several factors:
1. The decision itself regarding where and how to invest.
2. The amount of savings the person currently has.
3. The risks associated with the market at that time.
4. The overall economic conditions.

When making the investment decision, the person is aware of their current savings, but don't know the existing market risks and the prevailing economic conditions. Each of these factors plays a critical role in influencing the level of wealth.


Factors to be considered:
When considering a decision-making problem about investment, several factors need to be taken into account:

1. **Investment Decision**: This involves choosing how to invest your resources. It could mean deciding between different kinds of stocks, bonds, real estate, or other investment vehicles. The investment decision is influenced by the current savings. The market risk and the economic conditions are not known at the time of the decision, so the decision should not depend on them.

2. **Current Savings**: This refers to the amount of money you have already saved up that is available for investment. It plays a crucial role in determining how much you can afford to invest.

3. **Market Risk**: This factor represents the potential ups and downs in the market that can affect the outcome of your investment. It includes the volatility of the market and the associated risks.

4. **Economic Conditions**: These encompass broader economic factors like inflation, interest rates, economic growth, and job markets that can influence the success of your investment.

5. **Wealth**: This is the overall financial outcome that is impacted by your investment decision, taking into account your current savings, the market risks, and economic conditions.
