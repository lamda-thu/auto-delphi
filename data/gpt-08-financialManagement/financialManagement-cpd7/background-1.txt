Background:
In the decision-making scenario, a person is faced with the decision of how to invest their money. The outcome of this decision, which is the person's future wealth, depends on several factors:
1. The decision itself regarding where and how to invest.
2. The amount of savings the person currently has.
3. The risks associated with the market at that time.
4. The overall economic conditions.

When making the investment decision, the person is aware of their current savings, but don't know the existing market risks and the prevailing economic conditions. Each of these factors plays a critical role in influencing the level of wealth.
