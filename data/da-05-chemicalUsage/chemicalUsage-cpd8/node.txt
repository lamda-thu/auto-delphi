Background:
The decision-making problem revolves around the choice to use a chemical. This decision impacts the economic value derived from the chemical, which in turn influences the overall net value. At the same time, the decision to use the chemical also impacts the cost related to cancer treatment. The cost of cancer is influenced by three factors: the decision of whether or not to use the chemical, the level of human exposure to the chemical, and the chemical's carcinogenic activity. These factors collectively influence the final net value which combines the economic benefits and the cancer-related costs of using the chemical. This decision-making problem seeks to determine the viability of using the chemical by weighing its economic benefits against its health-related costs.


Factors to be considered:
When making a decision regarding the usage of a particular chemical or product, several factors come into play:

1. **Usage Decision**: This is the primary choice regarding whether or not to use the chemical.
2. **Economic Value**: This refers to the financial benefits or impacts associated with using the chemical.
3. **Cancer Cost**: This involves the potential health costs, specifically relating to cancer, that could result from using the chemical.
4. **Human Exposure**: This factor considers the extent to which people might be exposed to the chemical.
5. **Carcinogenic Activity**: This assesses the potential of the chemical to cause cancer based on its properties.
6. **Net Value**: This represents the overall value, considering both the economic benefits and the health costs.
