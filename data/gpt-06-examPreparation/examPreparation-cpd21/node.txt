Background:
The decision-making problem revolves around how much studying to do for an exam. Several factors influence the final exam score, which is the ultimate outcome of interest. Firstly, the decision on how much to study will affect a person's current knowledge and health status. Naturally, more studying can increase knowledge but might affect health due to stress or reduced rest. Both the current knowledge and health status directly influence the exam score. Furthermore, the difficulty level of the exam, which is determined separately, also impacts the exam score. A tougher exam could lead to a lower score. Therefore, the decision on how much to study must consider these factors to optimize the exam score while maintaining a balance with health.


Factors to be considered:
In the decision-making problem, several factors come into play:

1. Study Decision: This involves the choice on how much and in what manner to prepare for an exam. It is a crucial decision that directly influences outcomes.

2. Current Knowledge: This refers to the pre-existing understanding or expertise one has before engaging in further study. This initial knowledge level can impact how well one performs in the assessment.

3. Exam Difficulty: This is an external factor that depicts how challenging the exam is. The level of difficulty can vary and will influence the final performance on the exam.

4. Health Status: This pertains to the physical and mental well-being during the preparation and on the exam day. Good health can enhance concentration and stamina, thus affecting performance.

5. Exam Score: This is the outcome or result of the exam which reflects the culmination of various influencing factors including the amount and effectiveness of studies, health condition, and the inherent difficulty of the exam. 

These factors need to be carefully considered to optimize performance and achieve desired results in the exam.
