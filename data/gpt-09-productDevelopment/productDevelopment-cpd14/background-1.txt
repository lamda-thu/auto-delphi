Background:
In the decision-making problem described, a company is facing a scenario where it must decide how much to invest in a product. The success and sales of the product in the market are influenced by several factors. First, the cost to develop the product plays a role in how successful it would sell. Additionally, the demand for similar products in the market also impacts sales potential. On another note, the productivity of the team tasked with developing the product can affect how likely the product is to succeed upon launch. Finally, this likelihood of product success upon launch then directly impacts its sales in the market. Thus, the company's initial investment decision must take into account these various aspects to gauge the potential financial outcome from the sales of the product.
