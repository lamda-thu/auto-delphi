Background:
The problem involves deciding how much insurance coverage per day an individual should choose, taking into account their age and gender. These personal factors influence the cost of the insurance premium each year and the expected daily expenses for long-term care. Additionally, gender affects the life expectancy, which also impacts the overall cost calculation. The goal is to determine the daily coverage amount while managing the total cost, which is affected by the chosen coverage amount, the insurance premium, and long-term care expenses. This decision requires considering how personal characteristics and chosen coverage influence both immediate and future financial factors.


Factors to be considered:
In this decision-making problem, we consider several factors:

1. **Age**: This factor influences various costs and insurance-related aspects. Older individuals might face different expenses and insurance premiums compared to younger ones.

2. **Gender**: This can affect life expectancy and financial elements such as insurance premiums and daily expenses.

3. **Maximum Coverage per Day**: This is a choice to be made. It dictates the daily maximum amount that an insurance policy will cover, which in turn influences insurance premiums and total cost.

4. **Life Expectancy**: This factor relates to how long an individual is expected to live, which can impact the overall cost planning.

5. **Long Term Care Expense per Day**: This concerns the daily expense for long-term care, which varies and contributes directly to the total cost.

6. **Insurance Premium per Year**: This is an annual cost that varies based on other factors like age, gender, and the chosen maximum coverage per day.

7. **Total Cost**: This is the overall financial impact, including all expenses and premiums, integrated over time. This is what one would ideally want to minimize or optimize according to their circumstances and choices made about coverage.
